# Incomplete Features:
Though many of the functionality have been developed, others have not been completely integrated owing to device requirements/payment as well as a lack of knowledge. But with proper knowledge with infrustructure might help to complete those functionalities by anyone as the codebase here in github repository contains high level documentations added bearing this in mind. Incomplete features:

-  Ticket payment: paymnet gateway is paid. you can procced till purchase and the data will be stored in firebase. if we will be able to manage payment gateway then it will be easily completed.
-  Tracking: Tracking is not possible due to device requirement and knowledge lackings.
